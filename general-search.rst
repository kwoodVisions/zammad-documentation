Search Cheat Sheet
******************

Tickets, articles (with attachments), users and organizations are indexed by default.

A simple search for all objects can be: "something". If you want to search for objects with certain attributes you can use "attribute: something".

* For example: "customer: some name"

With complex searches you can use conditions with () and AND/OR options.

* For example: "state: open AND (from:me OR from:somebody else)"

Note: In general you can use Elasticsearch queries for search (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html).
